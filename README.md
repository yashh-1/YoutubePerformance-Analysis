##  Project Workflow

### Step 1: Data Cleaning
- Removed missing/null values
- Converted date and time formats
- Filtered numeric columns
- Created:
  - `Revenue per View`
  - `Engagement Rate`

###  Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Pairplots of revenue vs views, subscribers, likes
- Distribution plot of estimated revenue
- Top 10 highest revenue-generating videos
- Revenue vs Views scatter plot
- Correlation heatmap

###  Step 3: Machine Learning
- **Model**: Random Forest Regressor  
- **Target**: `Estimated Revenue (USD)`  
- **Features**: `Views`, `Subscribers`, `Likes`, `Shares`, `New Comments`, `Engagement Rate`  
- **Evaluation**:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R² Score
- **Saved Model**: `youtube_revenue_predictor.pkl`

###  Step 4: Key Insights
- **Views** and **Engagement Rate** are the biggest revenue drivers  
- Videos with more **shares**, **likes**, and **comments** perform better  
- High CTR and watch time improve monetization
